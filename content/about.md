Welcome to my blog! Here I will write about what I have learned
and found interesting. Hope you will enjoy it.
### About me
Hi! I am Nodir. I love solving problems and creating things on computer.

My favourite editor is VSCode, though Intellij IDEA is also cool. I use Windows mostly,
however I love Linux's terminal. 

Currently, my primary interest in software engineering is backend development.
